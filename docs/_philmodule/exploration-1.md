# Kant's Categorical Imperative Overview

{% include exploration-header.html %}

## ET the Extra Terrestrial

Imagine for a moment that an alien has crash landed on Earth. Hearing of your renown as a moral philosopher NASA has brought you in to help advise them on their situation. They know that there is a lot to be learned by studying this creature, but they have in their short study this far determined that this is a being that possesses reason, poses no threat to Earth and wants to return home. To do so it needs to use NASA equipment to send a message into space.

What is the moral thing to do?

Take a moment to go to the pinned Piazza discussion where you should vote on if we should:

1. Keep it for awhile to study
1. Keep it forever to study
1. Let it phone home and study it only if it consents
1. Let it phone home and study it until its ride home arrives

Then make a post describing in about a paragraph why you think your solution is the right one. We will revisit this after we learn more about the categorical imperative.

## Intro to the Categorical Imperative

Kant's categorical imperative is a deontological moral philosophy. This means that it tries to prescribe a moral value to act. It does not look at the virtues or character of the actor nor does it look at the consequences of any particular act.

In brief the law is that one must "Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that is should become a universal law". We will look at this in a bit more depth in a bit.

## What can we answer?

We need to make sure that we appropriately understand the scope of what we can look at with the lens of the imperative. Lets look again at the basic formulation.

"Act only according to that maxim whereby you can at the same time will that is should become a universal law"

Kant clearly wrote much more than this single sentence, but this really sums up the theory. Take a moment and think about the following examples. Select the items you think it can answer.

- [ ] Is Bill Gates a good person?
- [ ] Is lying ever permissible?
- [ ] Is it more ethical to punch someone to stop them from harming a child than it is to stop them from harming an adult?
- [ ] Should people learn skills to better themselves?
- [ ] If one farmer planted a crop that withered and died but another planted a crop that flourished and fed her town, did one of those farmers perform an action that was more good than the other?

Depending on how you think about these questions, there may be ways to answer them both ways, but we will see that some of these make a lot more sense and are easier to answer using the categorical imperative than others.
