# Overview

There are many systems of ethics that have been proposed over thousands of years. They try to answer the question of how one should act in a particular situation. They let us answer questions about if an action or person is good or evil. In general the one thing they all have in common is that they are in some way deficient. There always tend to be edge cases that a particular system can't answer or answers in a way that is clearly incompatible with common sense.

This module will look at one system in particular, *Immanuel Kant's Categorical Imperative*

1. You should be able to describe the main components of the categorical imperative.
   1. What does it mean for a maxim to be universalizable?
   1. What is the difference between perfect and imperfect duties?
1. You should be able to apply the categorical imperative to determine if actions are right or wrong.
   1. Would the Categorical Imperative describe seeking to borrow money without returning it as ethical? Why or why not?
   1. Is failing to carry out a imperfect duty considered unethical?
1. You should be able to produce examples that show shortcomings of the Categorical Imperative.
   1. What is an example of a situation you believe the categorical imperative would produce an undesired outcome?
